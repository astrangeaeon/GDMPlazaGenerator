<h3>Raid on Starlight Harbor Mall: a Green Dawn Mall Scenario for 3-5 players and a GM.</h3> 

<p>The brainchild of a Mall Upgrader who ascended to a position of power, the rebranding of Green Dawn Mall into Starlight Harbor Mall was meant to bring the fabled shopping experience screaming into the 90s. Boasting a presence on the World Wide Web and a glamourous new aesthetic, Starlight Harbor Mall hungers more than ever to unite consumers with their desires.</p>

<p>With all the plaza renovations going on, you may not even recognize the old place--but scratch the fresh paint and you'll reveal a familiar shade of Green underneath the glitzy stars and despite the enormous ads promising the Mall as a place to RELAX and DISCOVER and LIVE, something smells rotten in the brand new Food Court.</p>

<p>You've always wanted something you couldn't find, so you and your friends followed the instructions of Tiff, the haunted looking college dropout who still hangs around the high school, who said there was a place you could go that had anything you desired. Now you're yawning in your local mall's empty second-shot theater at 2 AM, watching a foreign black and white film called <i>Aprili</i>. Falling asleep here, Tiff promised, would open a gateway into the Mall. As you drift off, the movie's sound fades, and you hear clearly a snippet of a heavy metal song:</p>

<h4>The polestar wheeled above my head<br>
Until such time it grew<br>
A deep well of despair I found<br>
The day my dreams came true</h4>

<h1>GM Section</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Raid on Starlight Harbor Mall is a scenario designed to be played with Green Dawn Mall.</h2>
  
  <div class="row">
	<div class="col-12">
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p><p>Compared to a regular Green Dawn Mall session, there's a larger emphasis on "plaza play", where the plazas themselves have more distinguishing features, and the stores all have names as well to aid the GM in improvisation. In addition, the player motivations are a bit different, where instead of rescuing a friend, each player must come up with something their teenage character desires that they seek out the Mall to obtain. Victory will be finding the desired thing or renouncing their desire and then escaping the Mall.<br><br>
Because all characters start with the "hungry" lesser harm, Raid on Starlight Harbor Mall also introduces the Food Court, an early location with different generation rules than a regular plaza, along with trash cans, which can be searched to find potentially useful things. Any plaza with an escalator or elevator can lead to the Food Court; it's up to the GM when it makes sense.<br><br>
One of the main additions is the plaza generator, representing an effort by the Mall Upgraders to improve the Mall and make it more inviting. Gone are the generic plazas and dreary Soviet Union style store names, replaced with a profusion of brand differentiations and specialized boutiques; if the Jump Rope Emporium doesn't have what you're looking for, perhaps That Locker Room Funk will!  </p></p><br>
<p>Once players have created their characters and figured out their desires and items and introduced themselves to the table, the module begins with them waking up and seeing an ad for Starlight Harbor Mall on the theater screen. It depicts an inviting plaza full of bustling shoppers, everyone smiling with too many teeth. They rise from their seats and walk into the screen, arriving at the first plaza.</p>

</div>

  <div class="col-4">
  <h4>Plaza Generation</h4>
  <hr>
  <p><p>The plaza generator is used to generate plazas, providing the GM with choices and the ability to reroll various elements until they find something they like, at which point they can "print screen" to save the details of the plaza in an easy to read format. The food court generator works similarly but pulls from some different tables.<br><br>The plaza generator can of course be used to add detail to a standard Green Dawn Mall game as well. An example of how this can work is provided later.</p>
</p>
</div>
  <div class="col-4"><p><p>A few notes on the results--anything referring to a friend can instead be considered to be about a random PC's desire. For example, if the players find a cassette tape with the friend's handwriting on the label in a trash can, that can be changed to be a tape with the name of a random PC's desire on it and the recording (once they find a tape player) being something related to it--perhaps shipping instructions that point to a place in the Lower Levels where it is held or a recording of a conversation between two unknown people that reference hiding the desired object in a specific place.</p>
</p>
</div>
<div class="col-4"><p><p>Some tables may have overlapping results; for example, if Restrooms comes up as a plaza feature under Utilities, there's nothing unusual about the restrooms unless the GM wants there to be. Conversely, if the Restrooms category is rolled, there's something special about the restrooms in that plaza, i.e. they are immaculately clean or one of the urinals is sentient.</p></p>

  </div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<h4>Table Details</h4>
<hr>
<p><b>Corridor Clues</b> are details the characters would notice in their current plaza around specific corridors. For example, if there are 4 corridors in the plaza and 2 corridor clues, 2 of the corridors have an observable detail about them--maybe the smell of industrial bleach can be detected coming from one and the other has an arrow advertising a store not in the current plaza in that direction. The GM should accommodate these clues into the next plaza if the players go in that direction. If an arrow is advertising Rob's Big Damn Hats down the corridor, it makes sense for Rob's Big Damn Hats to be a store in the next plaza. Similarly, if the smell of industrial bleach is coming from the plaza, it makes sense for there to have been some kind of spill or heavy duty cleaning in progress when the PCs follow that corridor.</p><br><br>
 <p>The Activity table has a few categories that might need some explanation.</p> 
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-4">
<p><b>Preparation/Aftermath</b> gives the GM a choice of whether to have the activity about to begin or already be completed; in essence, they must decide what offers more interest: a food fight about to kick off or the mess and casualties created after one has ended.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<p><b>Timer</b> presents a situation that the PCs don't necessarily need to involve themselves with, but if they do nothing, there will be a consequence. For example, if they notice teenagers painting the shell of a huge sleeping turtle and decide to check out a store, when they go back out to the plaza, the teenagers may be gone and the turtle may have woken up distressed with their new shell design.</p> 
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<p><b>StoreInPlaza</b> and <b>StoreFront</b> refer to one of the stores in that plaza; the GM decides which store would be the most interesting to have that particular detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<p><b>ImproverActivities</b> are simply actions being taken by the Mall Upgraders faction or their representatives with the goal of improving the Mall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<p>The Odd Object table has a few categories that might need some explanation as well.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-3">
<p><b>Banned</b> represent objects that the Heart of the Mall distrusts and fears. In reality, the dominant order can commodify even totems of direct dissent against it, but for the game, these objects exude a power completely at odds with the fundamental forces that the Mall controls and their possession will paint a target on the owner's back. They are quite valuable to the right Collector, of courseâ¦</p>
</div>
<div class="col-3">
<p><b>Original</b> means it comes from the GDM Odd Objects tables on page 18 or the Wandering Oddities table on page 19.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-3">
<p><b>PCDesire</b> is a placeholder for the thing that particular PC set as their goal. These don't necessarily need to be actual physical objects, though that is the most straightforward. A player in the playtest wanted their character to become a "console cowboy", so leaning in a cyberpunk direction I decided they would be able to find some skill chips that provided hacking skill. This presented their character with the choice of needing to find enough money to buy and install the chip reader in their head to use the chips they'd found or ultimately renounce their desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-3">
<p><b>SingingEgg</b> is just miscellaneous objects whose value should be self-evident from the description.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<h4 style="text-align:center;">General Advice</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-4">
<h5>A Note on Hunger</h5>
<p>Removing the "hungry" harm will feel like a significant power boost for the PCs, because it means an extra die in many cases. Consider having the Food Court arrive towards the end of the first third of the campaign, after the PCs have gotten into some scrapes, spent some of their money, and perhaps found some clues towards their desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<h5>A Note on Money</h5>
<p>Rather than track money specifically, each PC can start with 2d6 "money" for each inventory slot they want to fill up. Most things in the Mall probably cost between 1 and 6 money. Use your judgement or roll a d6 if you aren't sure how valuable a thing should be. Players should run into opportunities to make money as well as spend it; perhaps as a reward for helping an NPC or for selling a piece of real world kit to a Collector. The value of 'money' in these cases can also be adjudicated by a d6 roll--a Collector might be willing to part with 6 money for a bauble from the real world and conversely may find a sophisticated electronic device worth 1.</p> 
</div>
<div class="col-4">
<h5>A Note on Desire</h5>
<p>When a character finds their desire, you should encourage them to come up with another desire. This plays into the theme and also provides a justification for them sticking around to help their friends find their desires, instead of just splitting off to look for an exit.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<h4>A Note on Renouncing Desire</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-12">
<p>It may seem to be the easiest thing in the world, sitting around a table with their friends, for a player to say their character is renouncing their desire. But the Mall would not be so terrifying if it was that easy!<br><br>
A character can make <i>one</i> attempt to reounce their desire; in most cases, this will be a 2d6 and take the lower roll, unless certain Banned objects have been found or extraordinary narrative events have transpired or enlightened NPCs have been convinced to assist. Their friends can only help if they, too, have renounced their desire.<br><br>
Failing this roll has no consequence; it only means the character is human afterall, and won't leave the Mall until they've obtained their desire.<br><br>
Renouncing desire makes the Mall's various manifestations powerless against the PC--representatives of the Mall can no longer harm them.<br><br>
However, because the Mall contains all things that are desired and welcomes all beings that desire things, the character is not therefore immune to all danger.<br><br>

<h4>Plaza Generator Example</h4>
<p>An example follows of how to take the random results of a plaza generation and turn them into a usable encounter location.</p>

<!--We are working this out,
whether it is better to give up
our desires or give ourselves
over to them, and no one knows
what is best, or only a Bodhisattva does,
and that way of knowing is too much
work, so we say that no one knows.-->

<h1>Player Section</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Raid on Starlight Harbor Mall</h2>
<p>Follow the standard Green Dawn Mall character creation rules, with the below exceptions:</p>
<ol style="color:indigo";>
	<li>Choose a desire for your player character, something they want badly enough to follow up on a rumor from Tiff, the haunted looking older girl who still hangs around the high school. It doesn't have to be a physical object, though that's the most straightforward--maybe a guitar that is always in tune or a bowl that you never need to fill. Abstract desires--things like world peace or an end to hunger or the like--won't really work, but personal desires, like becoming a star athlete or learning how to beat anyone at chess, would be fine. Basically, to engage with the core theme of the scenario, your character needs to want something. Badly. It could be a gift for someone else, or for themselves, but not having it has led them to a desperate place.</li> 
	<li>You will start with "hungry" as a lesser harm. This will impact everything you do until you find some food. You can try to start with some food, but because your way into the Mall is through the second-shot theater in your local mall, you only have a 33% chance of food items not being confiscated. For each food item, roll a d6--on a 5 or 6, you can start with it. Otherwise, it gets confiscated and you don't get to replace an item in that slot.</li>
	<li>You can start with 2d6 'money' which takes up a slot. If you want to bring more money into the Mall, you can fill as many slots as you'd like with 'money', but each 2d6 takes up a slot.</li>
