<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-regular fa-circle dir-art aria-hidden="true" data-title="Art Supplies"></i> Used Blood</div>
<div class="panel">A popular stop for shoppers low on cash, the slightly sinister clerks are always busy buying blood no questions asked and deliver quality blood for edgy artists, vampires and health professionals; often crowded with so-called 'Mall Thralls' who gather up blood from accidents in the Mall for quick cash </div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-aquariums aria-hidden="true" data-title="Aquariums"></i> Whales For Sale</div>
<div class="panel">Well, to be exact, one elephantine whale is for sale, and it's probably way too expensive for you to buy; but tours are offered of its insides, said to be like a maze and hold treasure, hazards and glory for the wily and brave </div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle dir-pets aria-hidden="true" data-title="Pets"></i> Wild Horses</div>
<div class="panel">The earthy smell of manure and sweat drifts out from this store styled like a horse ranch where fine stallions both mechanical and real trot around behind a wooden fence; modern saddles, stylish horse shirts and riding glasses line the shelves</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-tobacco aria-hidden="true" data-title="Cigars and Cigarettes"></i> Wild Bill's Tobacco</div>
<div class="panel">Known for sponsoring infamous plaza smokeouts, this outlaw themed store prides itself on its brash, boastful identity that doesn't care about your feelings, just the finest tobacco bred for pungency and lingerability; scornful of gimmick flavors and colored smoke, they offer earthy saddle leather, sun sweat, gun oil and the dire fart smell from eating meat vegetables from the House of Gristle </div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle dir-magic aria-hidden="true" data-title="Magic Eye Shop"></i> Zoltar the Sorcerer</div>
<div class="panel">Not so much a store as an institution, Zoltar waits behind glass with his crystal ball to answer the questions of an endless line of the desperate and merely curious</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> Hole in One Tees / Golf War HQ</div>
<div class="panel">Dozens of different colored tees rest in quaint penny candy bins, coexisting uncomfortably with the hybrid rifleclubs made from exotic metals and woods, armored 8-seater golf carts, bulletproof pencil bags and metallic golf balls made with depleted uranium to reduce aerodynamic drag all to support Golf War, team stroke play mixed with paintball and bloodsport</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle dir-ski aria-hidden="true" data-title="Ski Supplies"></i> It's All Downhill</div>
<div class="panel"><img src="img/truck.gif"></div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> Jump Rope Emporium</div>
<div class="panel">The athletic employees of this vast sporting goods warehouse weren't always so spiteful and angry towards other stores, but when management mandated a three song soundtrack consisting of Van Halen's Jump, House of Pain's Jump Around, and Jump by Kris Kross played on repeat all shift, it was the only rational move</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> Kate's Crystal Balls</div>
<div class="panel">High risk games played with these balls reward gentle handling and expert accuracy, though no amount of caution can avoid player injury as shards of crystal draw blood from the scarred legs and arms of veteran crystal ballers</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> Master Hu Li's Dojo</div>
<div class="panel">Offering instruction, tournaments and a bevy of martial arts gear, the Dojo is a welcoming place to kick butt and get your butt kicked </div>

<div class="panel">Stocking ski supplies branded after famous figures in the East Coast-West Coast Hip Hop Rivalry, there's really no other place to buy a snowboard with Suge Knight's face on it, or try on ski goggles while listening to Tim Dog, Uncle Luke, Mobb Deep and other artists from both coasts </div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle dir-ski aria-hidden="true" data-title="Ski Supplies"></i> Oh Geez! Skis</div>
<div class="panel">Wholesome and family-focused, the ski gear branded with friendly cartoons and bright primary colors makes it perfect for parents seeking to shape their children into professional skiers by starting their infants and toddlers early</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle dir-ski aria-hidden="true" data-title="Ski Supplies"></i> Snow That Won't Melt On Ya</div>
<div class="panel">Selling the usual ski poles and skis, winter gear and goggles, what sets the store apart is the brisk trade in fake snow; sold by the hundredweight in wet, dry, and powder varieties, the white stuff will not melt but is difficult to keep clean and smells chemically, a problem easily resolved by mixing colorless snow scents (sold separately) into the bags before application</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> That Locker Room Funk</div>

<div class="accordion-dir"><i class="fa fa-solid fa-circle-dot dir-sports aria-hidden="true" data-title="Sporting Goods"></i> What Kind of Ball Would You Like Today, Sir?</div>
<div class="panel">Obsequious clerks have been trained to ask every individual who enters the store the same question, suffering an existential struggle when the customer's answer isn't in stock</div>
