<h1 id="overview" class="col-md-12" style="text-align:left";>Overview</h1>
<p class="col-md-6">Compared to a regular Green Dawn Mall session, Raid on Starlight Harbour Mall has a larger emphasis on "plaza play", where the plazas themselves have more distinguishing features, and the stores all have names as well to aid the GM in improvisation. In addition, the player motivations are a bit different, where instead of rescuing a friend, each player must come up with something their teenage character desires that they seek out the Mall to obtain. Victory will be finding the desired thing or renouncing their desire and then escaping the Mall.<br><br>
One of the main additions is the plaza generator, representing an effort by the Mall Upgraders to improve the Mall and make it more inviting. Gone are the generic plazas and dreary Soviet Union style store names, replaced with a profusion of brand differentiations and specialized boutiques; if the Jump Rope Emporium doesn't have what you're looking for, perhaps That Locker Room Funk will!<br><br></p>
<p class="col-md-6">Because all characters start with the "hungry" lesser harm, Raid on Starlight Harbour Mall also introduces the Food Court, an early location with different generation rules than a regular plaza, along with trash cans, found in most plazas, which can be searched to find potentially useful things, including food. Any plaza with an escalator or elevator can lead to the Food Court; it's up to the GM when it makes sense to introduce.
<br><br>
Once players have created their characters and figured out their desires and items and introduced themselves to the table, the module begins with them waking up and seeing an ad for Starlight Harbour Mall on the theater screen. It depicts an inviting plaza full of bustling shoppers, everyone smiling with too many teeth. They rise from their seats and walk into the screen, arriving at the first plaza.</p>
<h1 id="plazageneration" class="col-md-12" style="text-align:left";>Plaza Generation</h1>
<p class="col-md-12">The plaza generator is used to generate plazas, providing the GM with choices and the ability to
reroll various elements until they find something they like, at which point they can "copy"
to save the details of the plaza in an easy to work with format. The food court generator works
similarly but pulls from some different tables.</p>
<p class="col-md-12">The plaza generator can of course be used to add detail to a standard Green Dawn Mall game as
well.</p>

<h2 class="col-md-12" style="text-align:center">A few notes on the results</h2>
</div>
<div class="row gx-5">

<div class="col-md-6">Anything referring to a friend can instead be<br>
considered to be about a random PC's desire.
<div style="background-color:yellow; padding:45px; margin-top:30px">
<p><b>FOR EXAMPLE</b></p>
<p>If the players find a cassette tape with
the friend's handwriting on the label in a
trash can, that can be changed to be a
tape with the name of a random PC's
desire on it with the recording (once they
find a tape player) being something
related to it--perhaps shipping
instructions that point to a place in the
Lower Levels where it is held or a
recording of a conversation between two
unknown people that reference hiding
the desired object in a specific place.</p>
</div>



</div>
<div class="col-md-6" >Some tables may have overlapping results.
<div style="background-color:yellow; padding:45px; margin-top:56px">
<p><b>FOR EXAMPLE</b></p>
<p>If Restrooms comes up as a plaza
feature under Utilities, there's
nothing unusual about the restrooms
unless the GM wants there to be.
Conversely, if the Restrooms category
is rolled, there's something special
about the restrooms in that plaza, i.e.
they are immaculately clean or one of
the urinals is sentient.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">

<h1 id="tabledetails" class="col-md-12";>Table Details</h1>
<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Plaza Condition</b> and <b>Crowd Level</b> provide the GM with a general sense of a plaza, whether it's clean or neglected, packed with busy shoppers or desolate as the moon.
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Corridors</b> and <b>Elevators/Escalators</b> indicate how many corridors are in the plaza and whether or not there's an elevator or escalator. 
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<b>How the corridors stand out</b> are details the characters would notice in their current plaza around specific corridors. The goal is to give players some information they can use to decide which direction to go in.
</div>
<div class="col-md-8 mobile-linebreak">
For example, if there are 4 corridors in the plaza and 2 corridor
clues, 2 of the corridors have an observable detail about
them--maybe the smell of industrial bleach can be detected
coming from one and the other has an arrow advertising a store
not in the current plaza in that direction. The GM should
accommodate these clues into the next plaza if the players go in
that direction. If an arrow is advertising Rob's Big Damn Hats
down the corridor, it makes sense for Rob's Big Damn Hats to be
a store in the next plaza. Similarly, if the smell of industrial
bleach is coming from the plaza, it makes sense for there to have
been some kind of spill or heavy duty cleaning in progress when
the PCs follow that corridor.
</div>
<div class="col-md-4 mobile-linebreak">
<b>Features</b> are primarily the eye-catching point of interest for the players in a plaza. They could range from weird restrooms to a massive aquarium to a maze of concrete planters. They may be under construction or being repaired. 
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Sensory Details</b> are things the GM can add to help set the atmosphere of the plaza. 
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
<button class="accordion-gdm">Synesthesia</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>These are sensations that don't fall under one of the ordinary senses and help convey the unique atmosphere of the Mall.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Goings On</b> are similar to Features but generally of a more emergent nature.
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">

<button class="accordion-gdm">Preparation or Aftermath</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p> Gives the GM a choice of whether to have the activity about to begin or already be completed; in essence, they must decide what offers more interest: a food fight about to kick off or the mess and casualties created after one has ended.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">Timer</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Presents a situation that the PCs don't necessarily need to involve themselves with, but if they do nothing, there will be a consequence. For example, if they notice teenagers painting the shell of a huge sleeping turtle and decide to check out a store, when they go back out to the plaza, the teenagers may be gone and the turtle may have woken up distressed with their new shell design.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">Store in Plaza and Storefront</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Refers to one of the stores in that plaza; the GM decides which store would be the most interesting to have that particular detail.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">Upgrader Activity</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Actions being taken by the Mall Upgraders faction or their representatives with the goal of improving the Mall.</p>
</div>


</div>

<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Trash Cans</b> can be found in most plazas and can be searched by desperate players. 
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">
</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Odd Objects</b> are things that might be found in the plaza or one of its stores. The category provides some context for its use or inspiration.
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">

<button class="accordion-gdm">Banned</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Represent objects that the Heart of the Mall distrusts and fears. In reality, the dominant order can commodify even totems of direct dissent against it, but for the game, these objects exude a power completely at odds with the fundamental forces that the Mall controls and their possession will paint a target on the owner's back. They are quite valuable to the right Collector, of courseâ¦</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">GDM Odd Objects</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Means it comes from the GDM Odd Objects table on page 18 of the Green Dawn Mall book.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">PC Desire</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>This is a placeholder for the thing that particular PC set as their
goal. These don't necessarily need to be actual physical objects,
though that is the most straightforward. A player in the
playtest wanted their character to become a "console cowboy",
so leaning in a cyberpunk direction I decided they would be able
to find some skill chips that provided hacking skill. This
presented their character with the choice of needing to find
enough money to buy and install the chip reader in their head to
use the chips they'd found or ultimately try to renounce their desire.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="col-md-12">     <br>
</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<b>Odd NPCs</b> represent a myriad of different NPCs players could encounter in the plaza. A detail or two may help the GM describe them or provide inspiration for an interesting encounter; not every detail may be apparent to the players at first glance. They may know things about the Mall, which they can be convinced to share if the price is right. 
</div>
<div class="col-md-8">

<button class="accordion-gdm">GDM Wandering Oddities</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Means it comes from the GDM Wandering Oddities table on page 19 of the Green Dawn Mall book.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">Enlightened</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>These NPCs from each different faction have achieved a level of self-understanding to see past what the Mall can offer them.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion-gdm">Triads</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Each of these NPCs are one of the three best or worst at something in the Mall. GMs can use them to introduce or solve problems, while leaving open the identities of the other two. Triads can also show up as an NPC detail. </p>
</div>

<h1 id="generaladvice" class="col-md-12";>General Advice</h1>

<div class="col-md-4">
<p>HUNGER</p>
<p>Removing the "hungry" harm will feel like a
significant power boost for the PCs, because it
means an extra die in many cases. Consider
having the Food Court arrive towards the end
of the first third of the campaign, after the
PCs have gotten into some scrapes, spent some
of their money, and perhaps found some clues
towards their desires.</p>

</div>

<div class="col-md-4">
<p>MONEY</p>
<p>Rather than track money specifically, each PC
can start with 2d6 "money" for each inventory
slot they want to fill up. Most things in the
Mall probably cost between 1 and 6 money. Use
your judgement or roll a d6 if you aren't sure
how valuable a thing should be. Players should
run into opportunities to make money as well as
spend it; perhaps as a reward for helping an
NPC or for selling a piece of real world kit to a
Collector. The value of 'money' in these cases
can also be adjudicated by a d6 roll--a
Collector might be willing to part with 6 money
for a bauble from the real world and
conversely may find a sophisticated electronic
device worth 1.</p>

</div>


<div class="col-md-4">
<p>DESIRE</p>
<p>When a character finds their desire, you
should encourage them to come up with
another desire. This plays into the theme and
also provides a justification for them sticking
around to help their friends find their
desires, instead of just splitting off to look
for an exit.</p>


</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h1 id="renouncingdesire" class="col-md-12";>A Note on Renouncing Desire</h1>
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>It may seem to be the easiest thing in the world, sitting around a table with their
friends, for a player to say their character is renouncing their desire. But the Mall
would not be so seductive if it was that easy!</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>A character can make <i>one</i> attempt to reounce
their desire; in most cases, this will be a 2d6
and take the lower roll, unless certain Banned
objects have been found or extraordinary
narrative events have transpired or
enlightened NPCs have been convinced to
assist. Their friends can only help if they, too,
have renounced their desire.</p>
<p>Failing this roll has no consequence; it only
means the character is human afterall, and
won't leave the Mall until they've obtained
their desire.</p>


</div>
<div class="col-md-6">
<p>Renouncing desire makes the Mall's various
manifestations powerless against the
PC--representatives of the Mall can no longer
harm them.</p>
<p>However, because the Mall contains all things
that are desired and welcomes all beings that
desire things, the character is not therefore
immune to all danger.</p>

<h3>Choose a desire</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
Choose a desire for your player character, something they want
badly enough to follow up on a rumor from Tiff, the haunted
looking older girl who still hangs around the high school. It
doesn't have to be a physical object, though that's the most
straightforward--maybe a guitar that is always in tune or a bowl
that you never need to fill. Abstract desires--things like world
peace or an end to hunger or the like--won't really work, but
personal desires, like becoming a star athlete or learning how to
beat anyone at chess, would be fine. Basically, to engage with the
core theme of the scenario, your character needs to want
something. Badly. It could be a gift for someone else, or for
themselves, but not having it has led them to a desperate place.

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3">
<h1 style="color:white">2</h1>
<h3>You are hungry</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
You will start with "hungry" as a lesser harm. This will impact
everything you do until you find some food. You can try to start
with some food, but because your way into the Mall is through
the second-shot theater in your local mall, and the retired cop
who works the door loves confiscating contraband, you only have a 33%
chance of food items making it in. For each food item,
roll a d6--on a 5 or 6, you can start with it. Otherwise, it gets
confiscated and you don't get to replace an item in that slot.

</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3">
<h1 style="color:white">3</h1>
<h3>Money</h3>
</div>
<div class="col-md-9">
You're going to the Mall to find something, so bringing money is reasonable.
You can start with 2d6 money which takes up a slot. If you
want to bring more money into the Mall, you can fill as many slots
as you'd like with money, but each additional slot for money is 
a 1d6 roll.

<h4>Table Details</h4>
<hr>
<p><b>Corridor Clues</b> are details the characters would notice in their current plaza around specific corridors. For example, if there are 4 corridors in the plaza and 2 corridor clues, 2 of the corridors have an observable detail about them--maybe the smell of industrial bleach can be detected coming from one and the other has an arrow advertising a store not in the current plaza in that direction. The GM should accommodate these clues into the next plaza if the players go in that direction. If an arrow is advertising Rob's Big Damn Hats down the corridor, it makes sense for Rob's Big Damn Hats to be a store in the next plaza. Similarly, if the smell of industrial bleach is coming from the plaza, it makes sense for there to have been some kind of spill or heavy duty cleaning in progress when the PCs follow that corridor.</p><br><br>
 <p>The Activity table has a few categories that might need some explanation.</p> 
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><b>Preparation/Aftermath</b> gives the GM a choice of whether to have the activity about to begin or already be completed; in essence, they must decide what offers more interest: a food fight about to kick off or the mess and casualties created after one has ended.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><b>Timer</b> presents a situation that the PCs don't necessarily need to involve themselves with, but if they do nothing, there will be a consequence. For example, if they notice teenagers painting the shell of a huge sleeping turtle and decide to check out a store, when they go back out to the plaza, the teenagers may be gone and the turtle may have woken up distressed with their new shell design.</p> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><b>StoreInPlaza</b> and <b>StoreFront</b> refer to one of the stores in that plaza; the GM decides which store would be the most interesting to have that particular detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<p><b>ImproverActivities</b> are simply actions being taken by the Mall Upgraders faction or their representatives with the goal of improving the Mall.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>The Odd Object table has a few categories that might need some explanation as well.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-3">
<p><b>Banned</b> represent objects that the Heart of the Mall distrusts and fears. In reality, the dominant order can commodify even totems of direct dissent against it, but for the game, these objects exude a power completely at odds with the fundamental forces that the Mall controls and their possession will paint a target on the owner's back. They are quite valuable to the right Collector, of courseâ¦</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<p><b>Original</b> means it comes from the GDM Odd Objects tables on page 18 or the Wandering Oddities table on page 19.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">
<p><b>PCDesire</b> is a placeholder for the thing that particular PC set as their goal. These don't necessarily need to be actual physical objects, though that is the most straightforward. A player in the playtest wanted their character to become a "console cowboy", so leaning in a cyberpunk direction I decided they would be able to find some skill chips that provided hacking skill. This presented their character with the choice of needing to find enough money to buy and install the chip reader in their head to use the chips they'd found or ultimately renounce their desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-3">

<h4 style="text-align:center;">General Advice</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>A Note on Hunger</h5>
<p>Removing the "hungry" harm will feel like a significant power boost for the PCs, because it means an extra die in many cases. Consider having the Food Court arrive towards the end of the first third of the campaign, after the PCs have gotten into some scrapes, spent some of their money, and perhaps found some clues towards their desires.</p>
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>A Note on Money</h5>
<p>Rather than track money specifically, each PC can start with 2d6 "money" for each inventory slot they want to fill up. Most things in the Mall probably cost between 1 and 6 money. Use your judgement or roll a d6 if you aren't sure how valuable a thing should be. Players should run into opportunities to make money as well as spend it; perhaps as a reward for helping an NPC or for selling a piece of real world kit to a Collector. The value of 'money' in these cases can also be adjudicated by a d6 roll--a Collector might be willing to part with 6 money for a bauble from the real world and conversely may find a sophisticated electronic device worth 1.</p> 
</div>
<div class="col-md-4">
<h5>A Note on Desire</h5>
<p>When a character finds their desire, you should encourage them to come up with another desire. This plays into the theme and also provides a justification for them sticking around to help their friends find their desires, instead of just splitting off to look for an exit.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
<h4>A Note on Renouncing Desire</h4>
</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-md-12">
<p>It may seem to be the easiest thing in the world, sitting around a table with their friends, for a player to say their character is renouncing their desire. But the Mall would not be so terrifying if it was that easy!<br><br>
A character can make <i>one</i> attempt to reounce their desire; in most cases, this will be a 2d6 and take the lower roll, unless certain Banned objects have been found or extraordinary narrative events have transpired or enlightened NPCs have been convinced to assist. Their friends can only help if they, too, have renounced their desire.<br><br>
Failing this roll has no consequence; it only means the character is human afterall, and won't leave the Mall until they've obtained their desire.<br><br>
Renouncing desire makes the Mall's various manifestations powerless against the PC--representatives of the Mall can no longer harm them.<br><br>
However, because the Mall contains all things that are desired and welcomes all beings that desire things, the character is not therefore immune to all danger.<br><br>

<!--We are working this out,
whether it is better to give up
our desires or give ourselves
over to them, and no one knows
what is best, or only a Bodhisattva does,
and that way of knowing is too much
work, so we say that no one knows.-->

<p>These generators can of course also be used for any Green Dawn Mall scenario to help add more flavor to the plazas and stores if desired.</p>

<p>Once players have created their characters and figured out their desires and items and introduced themselves to the table, the module begins with them waking up and seeing an ad for Starlight Harbour Mall on the theater screen. It depicts an inviting plaza full of bustling shoppers, everyone smiling with too many teeth. They rise from their seats and walk into the screen, arriving at the first plaza.</p>

<p id="Player"></p>
<h1>Player Section</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Raid on Starlight Harbour Mall</h2>
<p>Follow the standard Green Dawn Mall character creation rules, with the below exceptions:</p>
<ol style="color:indigo";>
	<li>Choose a desire for your player character, something they want badly enough to follow up on a rumor from Tiff, the haunted looking older girl who still hangs around the high school. It doesn't have to be a physical object, though that's the most straightforward--maybe a guitar that is always in tune or a bowl that you never need to fill. Abstract desires--things like world peace or an end to hunger or the like--won't really work, but personal desires, like becoming a star athlete or learning how to beat anyone at chess, would be fine. Basically, to engage with the core theme of the scenario, your character needs to want something. Badly. It could be a gift for someone else, or for themselves, but not having it has led them to a desperate place.</li> 
	<li>You will start with "hungry" as a lesser harm. This will impact everything you do until you find some food. You can try to start with some food, but because your way into the Mall is through the second-shot theater in your local mall, you only have a 33% chance of food items not being confiscated. For each food item, roll a d6--on a 5 or 6, you can start with it. Otherwise, it gets confiscated and you don't get to replace an item in that slot.</li>
	<li>You can start with 2d6 'money' which takes up a slot. If you want to bring more money into the Mall, you can fill as many slots as you'd like with 'money', but each 2d6 takes up a slot.</li>
</ol>
